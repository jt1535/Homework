# Python Homework (Data Types) 

**Note**: You can create a Python file or a Jupyter Notebook file

<br>

#### Data Types:

<ins>Use markdown formatting for the following questions (e.g., bold lettering, bullet points, different font sizes, etc.)</ins>: 

1. What is an algorithm?
    Instructions used to solve a problem
2. Variable names may not start with certain characters - name two.
    Numbers and Underscores
3. What is a Semantic error?
    Python did a function but it was not what you wanted.
4. What is the #1 rule of coding / debugging?
 To go slow at first until you learn it.   
5. List 5 Python reserved words.
TRUE
FALSE
IF
AND
OR
<br>

<ins>Open a code cell in your Jupyter Notebook and write the following code</ins>:

6. Write a multi-line string with your name, favorite food, and dream job on 3 different lines
7. Assign 5 different data types to 5 different variables. At least one datatype must be a string  
    - Print the length of your string
    - Print the index value of the 4th character in your string
8. Create a new variable called savvy, and assign it the string with this phrase "Learning Data Analytics and Python is Awesome!"
    - Return a range of characters that slices the above string from the beginning of  "ing" up to before "and"
    - Replace "Awesome" with "great" in the string
    - Test and print the savvy string to see it contains "Python"
9. Create and assign 3 more variables called name, age and length using the multi-variable  naming method
    - Format a new string called 'miniBio' using variables in curly brackets to complete this phrase... "Hi my name is (name), I am (tall) and (so) old today."
    - Print 'miniBio'
    - Cast and print the age variable to a float

<br>

#### Complex Data Types:

<br>

10. Create a list of at least 5 elements of mixed data types
    - Replace a part of it with something else
    - Append or insert several more items to the list
    - Find and print the length of the list
    - Slice a sub-section of the 1st list, and save it to a different 2nd list
    - Print the 2nd list
    - Extend your original list with the 2nd list sliced above
    - Create a new list called "simList" containing at least 5 elements of the same data type, either string, integer, float, or Boolean
    - Sort "simList", and print the list
    - Copy the "simList" list to another 3rd list
    - Add the 2nd and 3rd lists together into a 4th list

<br>

11. Create a tuple of about 5 elements
    - Multiply your tuple by 3 and save it to a new 2nd tuple
    - Access and print the 12th element from the 2nd tuple
    - Sort the 2nd tuple and print it
    - Copy 4 specific elements from your 2nd tuple to a new 3nd tuple
    - Unpack the 3rd tuple into 4 variables and print these variables
    - Create a 4th tuple with single item 50 and print this tuple
    - Add the 2nd and 3rd tuple together into a 5th tuple and print the tuple

<br>

12. Create a set of about 3 elements
    - Add a list of fruits to the above set and print the result
    - Add a car element to your set
    - Create a 2nd set with a few odd items
    - Save the union of 1st set and 2nd set to a 3rd set
    - Pop an element from the 2nd set, and print the remainder of the set
    - Clear the 1st set and print the result
    - Discard an element, and remove another element from the 3rd set
    - Print the remainder of the 3rd set

<br>

13. Create a dictionary with at least 5 values of different data types
    - Print out 1 value
    - Replace any one value in your dictionary with your name
    - Add your favorite color to the dictionary
    - Add a list, tuple or set to your dictionary
    - Print a list of the dictionary keys
    - Print a list of the dictionary values
    - Copy your 1st dictionary into a 2nd dictionary
    - Pop an item from the 2nd dictionary, and print the dictionary
    - Remove all the elements from the 2nd dictionary and print the result

#### When done with homework:
- **Due Date**: The following Monday before class
- Make sure your homework file is well named
- Add the homework to your Homework repo
- Use  `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, and `git push` to upload your homework changes to GitHub in the cloud
- Create a JIRA ticket to indicate that your Homework is ready for review:
    - <ins> In the "Summary" box</ins>: Include First Name and Last Initial, plus a short description in the Summary box (Ex: Jane D. Week # Homework Complete)
    - <ins> In the "Description" box</ins>: Include GitHub repo url 

<br>
